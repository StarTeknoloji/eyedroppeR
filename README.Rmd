# eyedroppeR <img src='dev/images/hex1.png' align="right" height="240" />

`eyedroppeR` allows you to choose an image, plot it and click on the image to return the hex codes of the selected pixel all within R.

There are a few ways to get colours from an image but this aims is to provide a simple, no fuss approach to get the hex codes into R.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("doehm/eyedroppeR")
```

## Usage

Use `eyedropper` with the following steps:

1. Find the image you want to pick colours from online.
2. Right-click and 'copy image address'.

    2.a As an example copy the following link to the clipboard (right-click > copy link address). `eyedropper` will read the copied address from the clipboard.

3. Choose how many colours to pick e.g. `n = 5`.
4. Run `pal <- eyedropper(n = 5)`. 
    
    4.a. If you have a local file or a saved `path` you can reference it directly with `pal <- eyedropper(n = 5, img_path = path)`
    
5. Click the 5 desired colours. The image will be stretched to the borders of the window, but that's OK.
6. Done! Copy the returned string and add it to your script and start using `pal`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pal <- eyedropper(n = 5)

Click on image to select colours

```
