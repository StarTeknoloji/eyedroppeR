# eyedroppeR <img src='dev/images/hex1.png' align="right" height="240" />

`eyedroppeR` allows you to choose an image, plot it and click on the image to return the hex codes of the selected pixel.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("doehm/eyedroppeR")
```

## Usage

Use `eyedropper` with the following steps:

1. Find the image you want to pick colours from online.
2. Right-click and 'copy image address'.
3. Choose how many colours to pick e.g. `n = 5`.
4. Run `pal <- eyedropper(n = 5)`. The function will read the copied address from the clipboard.
    
    4.a. If you have a local file or a saved `path` you can reference it directly with `pal <- eyedropper(n = 5, img_path = path)`
5. Click 5 areas of the image (or however many you chose). The image will be stretched to the borders of the window, but that's OK.
6. Done! Copy the returned string and add it to you script and start using `pal`.
